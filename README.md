Project: Raspberry Pi Synthesizer App

Team Members: Emmett Easter and Iskandar Shoyusupov 

Description: Our project is called the Raspberry Pi Synthesizer App which will be a game application where users/players are shown a musical pattern to replicate on their screen. If they replicate it correctly, they move on to the next level and earn points. As they replicate patterns on the app, music is played through a speaker set up on a raspberry pi.
